# Exercise 1

a. For any program $\pi$, $\mathbb{F} \Vdash [\pi] p \rightarrow \langle \pi \rangle p$ means that $R_\pi$ is serial.
    We have to show that if any basic program is serial, then all programs are as well.
    This can be proved by induction.

    - Suppose $R_{\pi_1}$ and $R_{\pi_2}$ are serial.
        Then, $R_{\pi_1 \cup \pi_2}$ is defined as $R_{\pi_1} \cup R_{\pi_2}$, which is serial: given any state $x \in W$, as $R_{\pi_1}$ is serial, there is a state $y \in W$ with $x R_{\pi_1} y$, and as $R_{\pi_1} \subseteq R_{\pi_1} \cup R_{\pi_2}$, $x R_{\pi_1 \cup \pi_2} y$.
    - Suppose $R_{\pi_1}$ and $R_{\pi_2}$ are serial.
        $R_{\pi_1 ; \pi_2}$ is defined as $R_{\pi_1} \circ R_{\pi_2}$.
        Again, this is serial: given any state $x \in R$, by seriality of $R_{\pi_1}$ there is a state $y \in W$ such that $x R_{\pi_1} y$, and by seriality of $R_{\pi_2}$ there is then a state $z \in W$ such that $y R_{\pi_2} z$.
        So, $x R_{\pi_1 ; \pi_2} z$.
    - Suppose $R_\pi$ is serial.
        $R_{\pi^*}$ is defined as the transitive and reflexive closure of $R_\pi$, which contains $R_\pi$ itself.
        So $R_{\pi^*}$ is also serial.

b. For any program $\pi$, $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \langle \pi \rangle \langle \pi \rangle p \rightarrow \langle \pi \rangle p$ means that $R_\pi$ is transitive.
    Consider the frame with three states $x$, $y$, and $z$, and the basic programs with associated relations $R_a = \{ (x, y) \}$ and $R_b = \{ (y, z) \}$.
    Then, $R_a$ and $R_b$ are trivially transitive, but $R_a \cup R_b = R_{a \cup b}$ is not (as $x(R_a \cup R_b)y$ and $y(R_a \cup R_b)z$ but not $x(R_a \cup R_b)z$).

# Exercise 2

a. We prove this by induction on the complexity of $\varphi$.

    - $\varphi = p$.
        True by the definition of monotone bisimulation.

    - $\varphi = \neg \psi$.
        $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \neg \psi$ if and only if $\mathbb{M}, w \not \Vdash \psi$.
        By induction hypothesis ($\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \psi \iff \mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \psi$), this is equivalent to $\mathbb{M}', w' \not \Vdash \psi$, which is $\mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \neg \psi$, by definition.

    - $\varphi = \psi \wedge \chi$.
        Very similar to the previous case: $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \psi \wedge \chi$ if and only if $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \psi$ and $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \chi$, which by the induction hypotheses ($\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \psi \iff \mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \psi$, $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \chi \iff \mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \chi$) is equivalent to $\mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \psi$ and $\mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \chi$, which is the same as $\mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \psi \wedge \chi$.

    - $\varphi = \langle\ ] \psi$.
        We will see that $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \varphi = \langle\ ] \psi \iff \mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \varphi = \langle\ ] \psi$:

        - $(\implies)$.
            By definition, $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \varphi = \langle\ ] \psi$ means that $\exists U \in N(w) \; \forall v \in U \; \mathbb{M}, v \Vdash \psi$.
            And, by hypothesis, $wZw'$, which means $\forall U \in N(w) \; \exists U' \in N'(w') \; \forall u' \in U' \; \exists u \in U \; uZu'$.
            By taking the set $U$ from the first statement and applying it in the second, we get that there is a $U \in N(w)$, and a $U' \in N'(w')$ such that:

            - $\forall v \in U \; \mathbb{M}, v \Vdash \psi$, and
            - $\forall u' \in U' \; \exists u \in U \; uZu'$.

            By induction hypothesis ($\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \varphi \iff \mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \varphi$), all $u' \in U'$ satisfy $\psi$.
            Hence, there is a $U' \in N'(w')$ such that all its elements satisfy $\psi$.
            Or, in other words, $\mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \langle\ ] \varphi$.

        - $(\impliedby)$.
            Similarly, we have $\exists U' \in N'(w') \; \forall v' \in U' \; \mathbb{M}', v' \Vdash \psi$, and also $wZw'$ means that $\forall U' \in N'(w') \; \exists U \in N(w) \; \forall u \in U \; \exists u' \in U' \; uZu'$.
            So, we have that there exist two sets $U \in N(w)$ and $U' \in N'(w')$ such that:

            - $\forall v' \in U' \; \mathbb{M}', v' \Vdash \psi$, and
            - $\forall u \in U \; \exists u' \in U' \; uZu'$.

            By the induction hypothesis, we deduce that every $u \in U$ satisfies $\psi$.
            So, $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \langle\ ] \psi$.

b. By the previous section, we only need to find a neighborhood model in which a given world satisfies a formula of the form $\ocircle \varphi$, and a bisimilar state does not.
    Consider the model $\mathbb{M}$ with worlds $\{x, y\}$, neighborhood assignments $N(x) = \{ \{ x \}, \{ x, y \} \}$, $N(y) = \varnothing$, and valuation $V(p) = \{ y \}$; and a model $\mathbb{M}'$ with a single world $z$, neighborhood $\{ z \}$, and empty valuation for the propositional variable $p$.

    Then, $Z = \{ (x, z) \}$ is a bisimulation.
    They share the same propositional variables (namely none).
    For each neighborhood of $x$ ($\{x\}$ and $\{x,y\}$), there is a neighborhood of $z$ ($\{z\}$) whose every element ($z$) has a predecessor by $Z$ in it ($x$).
    Similarly, given the only neighborhood of $z$, $\{z\}$, there is a neighborhood of $x$ ($\{x\}$) whose every element ($x$) has a successor by $Z$ in $\{z\}$ ($z$).

    Finally, we observe that $\mathbb{M}, x \Vdash \ocircle p$, as there is a neighborhood of $x$ ($\{x, y\}$) such that it contains one element ($y$) in which $p$ is true.
