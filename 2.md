# Exercise 1

1. We have to see that $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \mathbf{G} \psi \iff \mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \mathbf{G} \psi$ when $\mathbb{M}, w \leftrightarroweq \mathbb{M}', w'$, and taking as induction hypothesis that $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \psi \iff \mathbb{M}', w' \Vdash \psi$.

    By definition of $\mathbf{G}$, $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \mathbf{G} \psi$ iff there exists an infinite sequence $(w_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that $w = w_0$ and for all natural $i$, $w_i R w_{i+1}$ and $\mathbb{M}, w_i \Vdash \psi$.
    By definition of bisimulation, $w_i R w_{i+1}$ implies that $\exists w_{i+1}'$ such that $w_i' R' w_{i+1}'$ and $w_{i+1} B w_{i+1}'$.
    By that last property, we have that $\mathbb{M}, w_i \leftrightarroweq \mathbb{M}', w_i'$ for every natural $i$, and so $\mathbb{M}, w_i \Vdash \psi \implies \mathbb{M}', w_i' \Vdash \psi$.

2. It is sufficient to show two models $\mathbb{M}$ and $\mathbb{M}'$ such that $\mathbb{M}, s \Vdash D\phi$ and $\mathbb{M}', s' \not\Vdash D\phi$.

    We can take $\mathbb{M}$ to have worlds $\{ w_i \}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $\forall i \in \mathbb{N} \; w_i R w_{i+1}$, and $\mathbb{M}$ to have a single reflexive world $w$.
    All of $w$ and $w_i$ have $\phi$.

    As we saw in the lecture, these two models are bisimilar by relating every $w_i$ with $w$.
    But $w$ does not have $D\phi$, as its only successor is itself, whereas all $w_i$ do have $D\phi$.

3. By the note in parentheses, assume that $\mathbf{G}$ is expressible in the basic modal language and it is true in a finite tree $\mathbb{M}$.
    A finite tree has a finite amount of worlds and is free of cycles.
    So, if some $w \in \mathbb{M}$ has $\mathbf{G}$, there must at least be two elements of the infinite sequence defined by $\mathbf{G}$ that are the same.
    But that means that there must be a cycle in the tree, which is a contradiction.

# Exercise 2

1. $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \Diamond \psi$ implies that there exists a $v \in \mathbb{M}$ such that $wRv$ and $\mathbb{M}, v \Vdash \psi$.
    By the Euclidean property, every $u \in \mathbb{M}$ such that $wRu$ has $v$ as a successor as well.
    So every $u \in \mathbb{M}$ such that $wRu$ has $\mathbb{M}, u \Vdash \Diamond \psi$.
    Or, in other words, $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \Box \Diamond \psi$.

2. Consider the largest filtration $R^l$ on a model $\mathbb{M}$, and suppose $[x]R^l[y]$ and $[x]R^l[z]$.
    We suppose that $\mathbb{M}, z \Vdash \phi$ for some $\phi$ such that $\Diamond \phi \in \Sigma$.
    We want to prove that $\mathbb{M}, y \Vdash \Diamond \phi$ to see that $[y]R^l[z]$.

    As $[x]R^l[z]$, then $\mathbb{M}, x \Vdash \Diamond \phi$.
    By (1), that means that $\mathbb{M}, x \Vdash \Box \Diamond \phi$.
    But, as $[x]R^l[y]$, $\mathbb{M}, y \Vdash \Diamond \phi$.

3. Consider an Euclidean model $\mathbb{M}$.

    ($\implies$) Suppose $x \in \mathbb{M}$ has $\Diamond\Diamond\Box \phi$.
    Then there are $y,z \in \mathbb{M}$ such that $xRy$, $yRz$, and every successor of $z$ has $\phi$.
    By the Euclidean property, $xRy$ and $xRy$ imply that $yRy$.
    Then, we have both $yRy$ and $yRz$, so again by the Euclidean property $zRy$.
    Take any $w$ such that $zRw$.
    As we also have $zRy$, we can conclude that $yRw$.
    So, every successor of $z$ is also a successor of $y$.
    In conclusion, $y$ has $\Box \phi$, thus, $x$ has $\Diamond \Box \phi$.

    ($\impliedby$) Using a similar argument, any $y$ such that $xRy$ has $yRy$.
    Thus, if $x$ has $\Diamond \Box \phi$, then there is a $y$ with $\Box \phi$.
    But, as we have seen, such $y$ *also* has $\Diamond \Box \phi$, as it is its own successor.
    So $x$ has $\Diamond \Diamond \Box \phi$.

5. By (4) any filtration of an Euclidean model is finite, and by (2) it is also Euclidean, and filtrations preserve satisfiability of formulas in $\Sigma$.
