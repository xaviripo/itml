# Exercise 1

$(\implies)$ Assume that the time flow is discrete. Let us call $x'$ the immediate successor of an arbitrary state $x$. Suppose now that $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash (q \wedge \Box_P q)$. Then, $x'$ has the property $\Box_P q$. This means that $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \Diamond_F \Box_P q$, so $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \delta$.

$(\impliedby)$ Assume $\delta$ is true for a given state $x$, and assume that the flow of time is not discrete, so that for every $y > x$, there is at least one $z$ with $x < z < y$. We want to reach a contradiction.

Let $V$ be a valuation. If $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \delta$, then that means that either $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \neg (q \wedge \Box_P q)$ or $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \Diamond_F \Box_P q$. We can always choose $V$ so that $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash q \wedge \Box_P q$. Assume we pick one such $V$. Then, we are left with $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \Diamond_F \Box_P q$. But, for any $y > x$, there is always a $z$ such that $x < z < y$, and we can choose $V$ so that $z \notin V(q)$, so $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \not \Vdash \delta$, contradiction.

# Exercise 2

- By obtaining the union of bisimulations, we are adding new relations to each of them, not removing them.
    Hence, suppose $(w,w') \in Z = \bigcup_{i \in I} Z_i$. $(w,w')$ has to belong to $Z_k$ for some $k \in I$.
    Let us check the three properties:

    1. $\forall p \in \mathrm{Prop} \; \mathbb{M}_1, w \Vdash p \iff \mathbb{M}_2, w' \Vdash p$.
        This is still true as by adding new relations we have not changed the labels of each state.

    2. $\forall v \in W \; wRv \implies \exists v' \in W' \; w'R'v' \text{ and } vZv'$.
        Naturally $vZ_k v' \implies vZv'$, and the other relationships have not been changed.

    3. $\forall v' \in W' \; w'R'v' \implies \exists v \in W \; wRv \text{ and } vZv'$.
        As in the previous property, $vZ_k v' \implies vZv'$, and the other relationships have not been changed.

- Suppose a model $\mathbb{M}_1$ with a single state $x$ and no labels, and a model $\mathbb{M}_2$ with two unconnected states $y$ and $z$ with no labels.
    Then, we have two bisimulations $Z_1 = \{(x,y)\}$ and $Z_2 = \{(x,z)\}$, such that $Z_1 \cap Z_2 = \varnothing$, which cannot be a bisimulation by definition.

# Exercise 3

a. $(\implies)$ If $\nabla \Phi$ is satisfiable, it means there is a model in which some state $x$ has the property $\nabla \Phi$.
    By definition this means that each $\phi \in \Phi$ holds in at least one successor state of $x$.
    This fulfills the definition of satisfiability for each $\phi$.

    $(\impliedby)$ Let us enumerate $\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\} = \Phi$. For every $i \in \{1,\dots,n\}$, there is a model $\mathbb{M}_i$ with a state $x_i$ such that $\phi_i$ holds in $x_i$.

    Then, we can build a model $(W,R,V)$ in which $\nabla \Phi$ holds like this: let $W$ be the disjoiunt union of the states of each $\mathbb{M}_i$, together with a new state $x$.
    Let $R$ be the union of all the relationships of each model, and add to that $xRx_i$ for each $i$.
    Let $V$ the union of each valuation.
    Then, $\nabla \Phi$ holds at $x$: each neighbor of $x$ satisfies one of $\phi \in \Phi$, as modal formulas do not change their validity by adding predecessors, and each formula has at least one neighbor where it is true.

b. Take $\phi_0 = \Box p$ and $\phi_1 = \Box \neg p$.
    Observe that in any reflexive frame, a state having property $\phi_0$ implies $p$ is true on such state, and, conversely, $\phi_1$ implies $\neg p$.
    Consequently, no state can have both $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$.
    The single world reflexive frame satisfies both formulas, the first one with $p$ being true on the state and the other one with $p$ being false on the state.

    Suppose now we have a reflexive frame, with a state $x$ on which $\nabla \{\phi_0, \phi_1\}$ holds.
    Then, $x$ itself must either have $\phi_0$ or $\phi_1$, as it is a successor of itself.
    If it has $\phi_0$, then all its successors must have $p$, so none of them can have $\phi_1$.
    But if it has $\phi_1$, all its successors must have $\neg p$, so none of them can have $\phi_0$.
    Thus, no reflexive frame can have $\nabla \{\phi_0, \phi_1\}$.
