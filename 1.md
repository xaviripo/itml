# Exercise 1

$(\implies)$ Assume that the time flow is discrete. Let's call $x'$ the immediate successor of an arbitrary state $x$. Suppose now that $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash (q \wedge \Box_P q)$. Then, $x'$ has the property $\Box_P q$. This means that $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \Diamond_F \Box_P q$, so $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \delta$.

$(\impliedby)$ Assume $\delta$ is true for a given state $x$, and assume that the flow of time is not discrete, so that for every $y > x$, there is at least one $z$ with $x < z < y$. We want to reach a contradiction.

Let $V$ be a valuation. If $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \delta$, then that means that either $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \neg (q \wedge \Box_P q)$ or $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \Diamond_F \Box_P q$. We can always choose $V$ so that $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash q \wedge \Box_P q$. Assume we pick one such $V$. Then, we are left with $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \Vdash \Diamond_F \Box_P q$. But, for any $y > x$, there is always a $z$ such that $x < z < y$, and we can choose $V$ so that $z \notin V(q)$, so $(\mathbb{T}, V), x \not \Vdash \delta$, contradiction.
