Throughout the exercises we freely apply the fact that, for a normal modal logic $L$, $\Gamma \vdash_L \varphi$ if and only if $\varphi \in \Gamma$, for any $L$-MCS $\Gamma$.

# Exercise 1

a. As proved in class, we only need to show that the canonical frame for $\mathbf{S4.3}$ is reflexive, transitive, and linear.
    As per the final note, we can skip the check for reflexivity and transitivity.

    So, we can just show that the canonical frame $(W, R)$ has the property $\forall x \forall y \forall z ((xRy \wedge xRz) \rightarrow (yRz \vee zRy))$.

    So, for any three $\mathbf{S4.3}$-MCS $\Gamma$, $\Delta$, $\Epsilon$; we have to prove that $(\Gamma R \Delta \wedge \Gamma R \Epsilon) \rightarrow (\Delta R \Epsilon \vee \Epsilon R \Delta)$.
    Suppose then that $\Gamma R \Delta$ and $\Gamma R \Epsilon$.
    By definition this means that whenever a formula $\Box \varphi$ belongs in $\Gamma$, then $\varphi$ belongs in both $\Delta$ and $\Epsilon$.
    We have to see that, for any given formula $\Box \varphi$ in $\Delta$, then $\varphi$ is in $\Epsilon$, or vice versa.

    Let then $\Box \varphi \in \Delta$, $\Box \psi \in \Epsilon$.
    By uniform substitution, and the fact that $\Box (\Box p \rightarrow q) \vee \Box (\Box q \rightarrow p)$ is an axiom of $\mathbf{S4.3}$, we have $\Box (\Box \varphi \rightarrow \psi) \vee \Box (\Box \psi \rightarrow \varphi) \in \Gamma$.
    By maximal completeness, either $\Box (\Box \varphi \rightarrow \psi) \in \Gamma$, or $\Box (\Box \psi \rightarrow \varphi) \in \Gamma$.
    Without loss of generality, let $\Box (\Box \varphi \rightarrow \psi) \in \Gamma$.
    As $\Gamma R \Delta$, $\Box \varphi \rightarrow \psi \in \Delta$.
    And because $\Box \varphi \in \Delta$ by hypothesis, we can apply *modus ponens* and obtain $\psi \in \Delta$.

    We assumed that $\Box \psi \in \Epsilon$, and we concluded that $\psi \in \Delta$, so $\Epsilon R \Delta$.
    Observe that we can always find a $\Box \varphi \in \Delta$, as, for example, every world has $\top$, hence $\Box \top \in \Delta$.

b. Observe that, because every reflexive, transitive frame satisfying $\forall y \forall z (yRz \vee zRy)$ is, in particular, a reflexive, transitive, and linear frame, then we obtain soundness immediately from the previous section.

    For completeness, we must show that every set of sentences $\Gamma_0$ that is $\mathbf{S4.3}$-consistent can be *satisfied* by some frame with these properties.

    As seen, the canonical model $(W, R, V)$ of $\mathbf{S4.3}$ is complete with respect to the class of reflexive, transitive, and linear frames.
    So, every $\Gamma_0$ can be satisfied by a MCS $\Gamma$.
    Now, consider the generated submodel $(W', R', V')$ defined by $W' = \{ \Delta \in W | \Gamma R^* \Delta \}$ and by restricting the accessibility relation and the valuation function to $W'$.

    The original frame was reflexive and transitive, and so the generated one is too.
    For the property $\forall y \forall z (yRz \vee zRy)$, consider any two worlds $\Delta$ and $\Epsilon$, and let us prove one can see the other.
    By definition of the frame, $\Gamma R^* \Delta$ and $\Gamma R^* \Epsilon$.
    But, as $(W, R)$ was linear, then $\Delta R \Epsilon \vee \Epsilon R \Delta$, so $\Delta R' \Epsilon \vee \Epsilon R' \Delta$, as we wanted to see.

# Exercise 2

a. Similarly, we must see that the canonical frame $(W, R)$ for $\mathbf{S4.2}$ is directed.

    Let $\Gamma$, $\Delta$, and $\Epsilon$ be $\mathbf{S4.2}$-MCS.
    We have to see that, if $\Gamma R \Delta$ and $\Gamma R \Epsilon$, then there exists another MCS $\Zeta$ such that $\Delta R \Zeta$ and $\Epsilon R \Zeta$.

    If we can prove that the set $\Zeta_0 = \{ \varphi | \Box \varphi \in \Delta \} \cup \{ \psi | \Box \psi \in \Epsilon \}$ is $\mathbf{S4.2}$-consistent, by Lindenbaum's lemma, there will be a $\mathbf{S4.2}$-MCS $\Zeta$ such that $\Delta R \Zeta$ and $\Epsilon R \Zeta$.

    Because each $\Box \varphi_i \in \Delta$ and each $\Box \psi \in \Epsilon$, $\Gamma$ contains $\Diamond \Box (\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n) \wedge \Diamond \Box (\psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m)$.
    If we can prove this formula is inconsistent in $\mathbf{S4.2}$, we are done.

    So, let us assume that $\Zeta_0$ is not consistent.
    In such case, there are finite sets of formulas $\{ \varphi_0, \dots \varphi_n \} \subseteq \{ \varphi | \Box \varphi \in \Delta \}$ and $\{ \psi_0, \dots, \psi_m \} \subseteq \{ \psi | \Box \psi \in \Epsilon \}$ such that $\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n \wedge \psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m \rightarrow \bot$.

    This is equivalent to $\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n \rightarrow \neg (\psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m)$.
    We can now introduce $\Box$ and $\Diamond$: $\Box \Diamond (\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n) \rightarrow \Box \Diamond \neg (\psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m)$.
    By the definitions of $\Box$ and $\Diamond$, we have $\Box \Diamond (\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n) \rightarrow \neg \Diamond \Box (\psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m)$, which is $\Box \Diamond (\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n) \rightarrow (\Diamond \Box (\psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m) \rightarrow \bot)$.
    Finally, by applying the axiom of the logic and transitivity of $\rightarrow$, we get $\Diamond \Box (\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n) \rightarrow (\Diamond \Box (\psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m) \rightarrow \bot)$.
    And from here, $\Diamond \Box (\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n) \wedge \Diamond \Box (\psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m) \rightarrow \bot$.

    So, we have proved $\Diamond \Box (\varphi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \varphi_n) \wedge \Diamond \Box (\psi_0 \wedge \cdots \wedge \psi_m)$ inconsistent in the logic $\mathbf{S4.2}$, contradiction.

b. We just have to apply the same reasoning as in Exercise 1 (b), constructing a generated submodel that has the proposed property.

    As seen, the canonical model $(W, R, V)$ of $\mathbf{S4.2}$ is complete with respect to the class of reflexive, transitive, and directed frames.
    So, every $\Gamma_0$ can be satisfied by a MCS $\Gamma$.
    Now, consider the generated submodel $(W', R', V')$ defined by $W' = \{ \Delta \in W | \Gamma R^* \Delta \}$ and by restricting the accessibility relation and the valuation function to $W'$.

    The original frame was reflexive and transitive, and so the generated one is too.
    Again, as in Exercise 1, every world in the generated subframe is seen by the root world $\Gamma$, hence making the left side of the conditional $(\Gamma R \Delta \wedge \Gamma R \Epsilon) \rightarrow \exists \Zeta (\Delta R \Zeta \wedge \Epsilon R \Zeta)$ always true, and hence $\exists \Zeta (\Delta R' \Zeta \wedge \Epsilon R' \Zeta)$ true for all $\Delta, \Epsilon \in W'$.


# Exercise 3

a. \-

b. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the class of finite, reflexive, transitive, and Noetherian frames.

    For soundness, note that every finite, reflexive, transitive, and Noetherian frame is a finite poset, and by the characterization of reflexive, transitive, Noetherian frames given in Exercise 2 of Homework 3, we immediately get the result.
    Finiteness, reflexivity, and transitivity are by hypothesis.
    Antisymmetry comes from reflexivity together with the Noetherian property: suppose $wRv$ and $vRw$.
    If $w \neq v$, then we have an infinite path $wRvRwRvR \dots$ such that any two consecutive terms are not equal.

    For completeness, we have to see that every $\mathbf{S4.Grz}$-consistent formula $\varphi$ is satisfiable in a finite poset.
    It is enough to see that $\mathrm{cut}(\mathbb{M}^t)$ is a finite poset, because then by Lindenbaum's lemma we can find a $\mathbf{S4.Grz}$-MCS $\Gamma$ such that $\varphi \in \Gamma$, and so $\mathbb{M}^{\mathbf{Grz}}, \Gamma \Vdash \varphi$ and by (a) $\mathrm{cut}(\mathbb{M}^t), [ \Gamma ] \Vdash \varphi$.

    Let us prove $\mathrm{cut}(\mathbb{M}^t)$ is a finite poset:

    - Finiteness is given by the fact that we are filtrating over a finite set of subformulas.
    - Reflexivity is given by definition of $R'$ and preserved by filtrations.
    - Antisymmetry is also guaranteed by the definition of $\mathrm{cut}$.
    - Transitivity has to be checked.
        Suppose $xRyRz$, but $\neg xR'y$.
        This means that $yRx$, hence $xRyRxRyR \dots$, breaking the Noetherian property of $\mathbb{M}^{\mathbf{Grz}}$.
        Similarly for $\neg yR'z$.
