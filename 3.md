# Exercise 1

a. Consider the frame $\mathbb{F}' = (W', R')$ constructed as such:

    For every state $x$ in $W$, take $W'_x$ to be $\{ (x, x_1, \dots, x_n) | x R x_1 R \dots R x_n \}$ and $R'_x$ such that $(x, x_1, \dots, x_n) R'_x (x, y_1, \dots, y_m)$ if and only if $m = n + 1$, $x_i = y_i$ for all $i \leq n$, and $x_n R y_m$.

    Then, we define $W'$ to be the disjoint union of all $W'_x$ and $R'$ to be the transitive and reflexive closure of the disjoint union of all $R'_x$.

    We define $f : W' \rightarrow W$ to be $f(x, x_1, \dots, x_n) = x_n$.

    We have to check that $\mathbb{F}'$ is indeed partially ordered, and that $\mathbb{F}$ is a bounded morphic image of $\mathbb{F}'$.

    - Transitivity and reflexivity of $\mathbb{F}'$ are true by definition of $R'$.
        Now, suppose $\mathbb{F}'$ is not antisymmetric.
        That means that there are $x$ and $y$ in $W'$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$, but $x \neq y$, i.e., there are non-trivial cycles.
        But the transitive and reflexive closure of a graph does not add non-trivial cycles if there were none to begin with.
        So, that means that the construction that we did for $W'_x$ has non-trivial cycles, which we saw in the lecture that is not true.
        So, $\mathbb{F}'$ is antisymmetric.

    - Let us check the properties of the bounded morphism.

        - $f$ is exhaustive.
            It is: by construction of $W'$, for every $x$ in $W$, the root of the tree $W'_x$ has $x$ as its image through $f$.

        - $w'R'v' \implies f(w') R f(v')$.
            By definition of each $R'_x$, $(x, x_1, \dots, x_n) R'_x (x, y_1, \dots, y_m)$ implies $x_n R y_m$, and by definition of $f$, $f(x, x_1, \dots, x_n) = x_n$ and $f(x, y_1, \dots, y_m) = y_m$, so $f(x, x_1, \dots, x_n) R f(x, y_1, \dots, y_m)$.

        - $f(w') R v \implies \exists v' \; w'R'v' \wedge f(v') = v$.
            Suppose $f(x, x_0, \dots, x_n) R v$.
            That means that $x_n R v$, by definition of $f$.
            By construction of $W'_x$, we have $(x, x_0, \dots, x_n, v) \in W'_x$, and by construction of $R'_x$ we also have $(x, x_0, \dots, x_n) R'_x (x, x_0, \dots, x_n, v)$.
            Finally, $f(x, x_0, \dots, x_n, v) = v$.

b. If $\varphi$ is valid for all reflexive and transitive frames, in particular it is valid for those that also are antisymmetric, i.e. the partially ordered ones.
    So we immediately have $\Phi_1 \subseteq \Phi_2$.

    To show the other inclusion, suppose $\varphi \in \Phi_2$.
    Now, let $\mathbb{F}$ be a reflexive, transitive frame.
    By (1), $\mathbb{F}$ is a bounded morphic image of a partial order $\mathbb{G}$.
    And, by a proposition seen in class, $\mathbb{G} \Vdash \varphi \implies \mathbb{F} \Vdash \varphi$.
    As $\varphi$ is in $\Phi_2$, $\mathbb{G} \Vdash \varphi$ is true, and then so is $$\mathbb{F} \Vdash \varphi$.
    Hence, $\Phi_2 \subseteq \Phi_1$.

# Exercise 2

Let $\mathbb{F} = (W, R)$ be an arbitrary frame.
We want to see that $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{grz} \iff R \text{ has (i), (ii) and (iii)}$.

- ($\implies$).
    By contraposition, we will assume that $\mathbb{F}$ does not have one of (i), (ii), or (iii), and from that conclude that $\mathbf{grz}$ is not valid in $\mathbb{F}$.

    - Suppose (i) does not hold in $\mathbf{F}$, i.e. there is some $x \in W$ such that $\neg xRx$.
        Consider the valuation $V$ such that $V(p) = W \setminus \{ x \}$.
        Observe that $\neg \mathbf{grz}$ is equivalent to $\Box (\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p) \wedge \neg p$.
        We have already established that $(W, R, V), x \Vdash \neg p$ by defining $V$.

        Now, we want to see that $(W, R, V), x \Vdash \Box (\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p)$.
        Observe that, if all successors of $x$ had $p$, then $\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p$ would be true for them as the consequent would be true.
        As $\neg xRx$ by hypothesis, the valuation $V$ makes it so every successor of $x$ has $p$, and hence $x \Vdash \neg \mathbf{grz}$.

    - Suppose (ii) does not hold, but (i) does.
        This means that there exist $x, y, z \in W$ such that $xRy$, $yRz$, and $\neg xRz$.
        Let us assign $V(p) = \{ y \in W | xRy \} \setminus \{ x \}$.
        We want to prove $(W, R, V), x \Vdash \neg \mathbf{grz}$, which is equivalent to $\Box (\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p) \wedge \neg p$.
        It is necessary to check that $x \Vdash \Box (\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p)$.
        This is equivalent to $x' \Vdash \Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p$ for every successor $x'$ of $x$.
        By definition of $V$, it is immediately true for all except for $x$ itself.
        To see that it is also true for $x$, observe that it is equivalent to $x \Vdash \neg \Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \vee p$.
        As $x \not\Vdash p$, we need to prove that $x \Vdash \neg \Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \iff x \Vdash \Diamond \neg (p \rightarrow \Box p) \iff x \Vdash \Diamond (p \wedge \Diamond \neg p)$, or, in other words, $x$ has a successor which has $p$ and which has a successor of its own without $p$.
        That successor is $y$, which has $p$ by definition of $V$, and has a successor $z$ which does *not* have $p$, because $\neg xRz$ by hypothesis.

    - Finally, suppose (iii) does not hold but (i) and (ii) do.

        Suppose $R$ has an infinite chain $\{ x_i \}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ as the one described in (iii), with some repeated state, i.e. such that $\exists k \in \mathbb{N} \; \exists j < k \; x_k = x_j$.
        By the conditions of (iii), $x_{j+1} \neq x_j$.
        By transitivity, $x_{j+1} R x_k$, so $x_{j+1} R x_j$.
        So we have a cycle of the form $x_j R x_{j+1} R x_j$, with $x_j \neq x_{j+1}$.
        Let us rename $x_j = x$ and $x_{j+1} = y$
        Consider then a valuation $V$ such that $V(p) = \{ y \in W | xRy \} \setminus \{ x \}$.
        We claim that $(W, R, V), x \Vdash \neg \mathbf{grz} \iff x \Vdash \Box (\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p) \wedge \neg p$.
        We already have seen $x \Vdash \neg p$.
        Let us see that $x \Vdash \Box (\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p)$.
        Every successor of $x$ except $x$ has $p$.
        So we only need to check that $x$ has $\neg \Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \iff \Diamond (p \wedge \Diamond \neg p)$.
        But it does: $y$ is a successor of $x$ that has $p$, and with a successor ($x$) that does not have $p$.

        Suppose now, alternatively, that the chain is composed by distinct elements, so $\forall k \in \mathbb{N} \; \forall j < k \; x_k \neq x_j$.
        Consider then the valuation $V$ such that $V(p) = \{ x | \neg \exists k \in \mathbb{N} \; x = x_{2k} \}$, and let us prove that $(W, R, V), x_0 \Vdash \neg \mathbf{grz}$.
        Once again, we first observe that $x_0 \not\Vdash p$, and look at whether $x_0$ satisfies $\Box (\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p)$.
        And, again, we consider two cases for the successors of $x_0$:

        - $x_i$ with even $i$.
            They do not have $p$, so we need to see they satisfy $\Diamond (p \wedge \Diamond \neg p)$.
            We observe that $x_{i+1} \Vdash p$ and $x_{i+1} \Vdash \Diamond \neg p$ (in particular, $x_{i+2} \Vdash \neg p$).

        - All other successors of $x_0$.
            As they have $p$, they satisfy $\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p$.

- ($\impliedby$).
    By *reductio ad absurdum*, let us assume that $\mathbf{grz}$ is valid in $\mathbb{F} = (W, R)$, and that $R$ has properties (i), (ii), and (iii) as described in the exercise.

    So, by huypothesis, suppose there is a valuation $V$ and a state $x$ such that $(W, R, V), x \Vdash \neg \mathbf{grz}$; equivalently: $x \Vdash \Box (\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p) \wedge \neg p$.
    This implies that $x \notin V(p)$.
    And, for all successors of $x$, $x'$, must satisfy $\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow p \iff \Diamond (p \wedge \Diamond \neg p) \vee p$.
    In particular, $xRx$ (by (i)), so $x \Vdash \Diamond (p \wedge \Diamond \neg p)$, i.e. there is some $y$ such that $xRy$ and $y \Vdash p \wedge \Diamond \neg p$.
    As $y \Vdash p$, $y \neq x$.
    Following a similar argument, $y$ has a successor, $z$, such that $z \Vdash \neg p$.
    If $z = x$, we would have a non-trivial cycle $xRyRx$, which would contradict (iii).
    So, we have $xRyRz$, but by transitivity, that means $xRz$.
    That means that $z$ must also satisfy $\Box (p \rightarrow \Box p) \rightarrow$.
    We saw that $z \Vdash \neg p$, so $z \Vdash \Diamond (p \wedge \Diamond \neg p)$.
    But, by this condition, we can find $y'$ and $z'$ as we did with $y$ and $z$ earlier.
    So, by repeating this process, we would end up with an infinite chain, disallowed by (iii).

# Exercise 3

a. Let $\mathbb{M} = (W, R, V)$ be an arbitrary model, and $w \in W$ any state.
    We want to see that $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \varphi^+ \iff \mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \varphi$.
    We will do it by induction on the complexity of a formula $\chi$:

    - $\chi = p$.
        By definition of $-^+$, $p^+ = p$, so $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash p^+ \iff \mathbb{M}, w \Vdash p \iff \mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash p$.

    - $\chi = \varphi \vee \psi$.
        $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash (\varphi \vee \psi)^+ \iff \mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \varphi^+$ or $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \psi^+ \iff \mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \varphi$ or $\mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \psi \iff \mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash (\varphi \vee \psi)$.

    - $\chi = \neg \varphi$.
        $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash (\neg \varphi)^+ \iff \mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \neg \varphi^+ \iff not \mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \varphi^+ \iff not \mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \varphi \iff \mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \neg \varphi$.

    - $\chi = \Diamond \varphi$.
        $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash (\Diamond \varphi)^+ \iff \mathbb{M}, w \Vdash (\Diamond \varphi^+) \vee \varphi^+$. There are two possibilities:

        - $\exists v, wRv$ such that $\mathbb{M}, v \Vdash \varphi^+$.
            By induction hypothesis, this is equivalent to $\exists v, wRv$ such that $\mathbb{M}^r, v \Vdash \varphi$.
            This is the same as $\mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \Diamond \varphi$.

        - $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \varphi^+$, which by induction hypothesis is equivalent to $\mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \varphi$.

        The disjunction of these two possibilities is precisely $\mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash (\Diamond \varphi) \vee \varphi$.
        But, on a reflexive model, $(\Diamond \varphi) \vee \varphi \iff \Diamond \varphi$.
        So, we have $\mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \Diamond \varphi$.

    As we showed that $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \varphi^+ \iff \mathbb{M}^r, w \Vdash \varphi$ for every possible valuation and state, we have proven it for frames in general: $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \varphi^+ \iff \mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \varphi$.

b. By (a), for any given frame $\mathbb{F}$ and formula $\varphi$, $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl} \implies \mathbb{F} \Vdash \varphi^+$ is equivalent to $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl} \implies \mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \varphi$.

    So, we want to see that $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{grz} \implies \mathbb{F} \Vdash \varphi \iff \mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl}$ is equivalent to $\mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \varphi$.

    Observe that:

    - If we prove $\mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \mathbf{grz} \implies \mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl}$, and if we assume $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl} \implies \mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \varphi$, we obtain: $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{grz} \implies \mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \mathbf{grz} \implies \mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl} \implies \mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \varphi \implies \mathbb{F} \Vdash \varphi$, as $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{grz}$ implies it is reflexive, as shown in Exercise 2.

    - Similarly, by proving $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl} \implies \mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \mathbf{grz}$, and assuming $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{grz} \implies \mathbb{F} \Vdash \varphi$, we can prove that $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl} \implies \mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \varphi$.

    So, in summary, it is sufficient to prove $\mathbb{F}^r \Vdash \mathbf{grz} \iff \mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl}$ to complete the exercise.
    Naturally, $\mathbb{F}^r$ is reflexive, so we just have to prove that $\mathbb{F} \Vdash \mathbf{gl} \iff \mathbb{F}$ has properties (ii) and (iii) from Exercise 2.

    - ($\implies$).
        By *reductio ad absurdum*, suppose either (ii) or (iii) do not hold.

        - (ii) does not hold.
            Let $xRy$, $yRz$, $\neg xRz$.
            As in the previous exercise, consider the valuation $V$ such that $V(p)$ contains all worlds except $y$ and $z$.
            We want to see that $x \Vdash \Box (\Box p \rightarrow p) \wedge \Diamond \neg p$.
            $\Diamond \neg p$ is true for $x$, as $y \notin V(p)$.
            For all successors of $x$ different than $y$, $\Box p \rightarrow p$ is true, as they have $p$.
            And, for $y$, we have $z \notin V(p)$.
            As $z$ is not a successor of $x$, this does not interfere with our previous claim that all successors of $x$ other than $y$ have $p$.

        - (iii) does not hold.
            Very similarly to our proof in Exercise 2, we assume that there either is a non-trivial cycle $xRyRx$, or that there is an infinite chain of states $\{ x_i \}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ , all different.

            In the first case, by assigning $p$ to all states but $x$, and in the second, by assigning $p$ to all states except $x_i$ with even $i$, we obtain models in which $\neg \mathbf{gl}$ is satisfied, by similar methods as in Exercise 2.
