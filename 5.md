# Exercise 1

For both (a) and (b), we have to see that $\vdash_{L} \varphi \iff \mathrm{FinFr}(L) \Vdash \varphi$, where $L$ is either $\mathbf{S4.2}$ or $\mathbf{S4.3}$, as appropriate.

For left to right, observe the fact that $\mathrm{FinFr}(L) \subseteq \mathrm{Fr}(L)$.
If $L$ is sound, we have $\vdash_{L} \varphi \implies \mathrm{Fr}(L) \Vdash \varphi$ by definition, and because of the inclusion we also have $\mathrm{Fr}(L) \Vdash \varphi \implies \mathrm{FinFr}(L) \Vdash \varphi$, so by transitivity $\vdash_{L} \varphi \implies \mathrm{FinFr}(L) \Vdash \varphi$, as desired.

For the other direction, we use contraposition.
Suppose $\not \vdash_{L} \varphi$, we want to deduce that there is some finite model $\mathbb{M}'$ that does not satisfy $\varphi$.
If $L$ is complete, we have that $\not \vdash_{L} \varphi$ implies that there is some model $\mathbb{M}$ and some world $w$ such that $\mathbb{M}, w \Vdash \neg \varphi$.
Then, let us consider a filtration $\mathbb{M}'$ by the set $\mathsf{sub}(\varphi)$, such that its underlying frame is in $\mathrm{Fr}(L)$.
As $\mathsf{sub}(\varphi)$ is finite, so is $\mathbb{M}'$, so its frame is in $\mathrm{FinFr}(L)$.
And, by the filtration theorem, $\mathbb{M}', [w] \Vdash \neg \varphi$.
So, we have that $\mathbb{M}'$ does not satisfy $\varphi$, as we wanted to see.

For the second part of each section (a) and (b), we have to prove $\vdash_{L} \varphi \iff \mathcal{C} \Vdash \varphi$ for the finite class of frames $\mathcal{C}$ in question.
In both cases, $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathrm{FinFr}(L)$, hence we get $\vdash_{L} \varphi \iff \mathrm{FinFr}(L) \Vdash \varphi \implies \mathcal{C} \Vdash \varphi$ immediately.
For completeness, we can use a different technique: prove that every consistent formula $\varphi$ is satisfiable in $\mathrm{FinFr}(L)$.
To do this we can apply a similar reasoning to that used in Homework 4: any consisten set $\{ \varphi \}$ can be extended to a $L$-MCS $\Gamma$, so that it satisfies $\varphi$ in the canonical model.
Then, by filtering the canonical model through $\mathsf{sub}(\varphi)$ using the same filtrations as before, we obtain a finite model that belongs in $\mathsf{FinFr}(\varphi)$, thus making $\varphi$ satisfiable.

a. $\mathbf{S4.2}$ is sound and complete, as seen in Homework 4.
    We just have to find a filtration that preserves reflexivity, transitivity, and directedness.
    All filtrations preserve reflexivity, and, as seen in Tutorial 3, the transitive closure of any filtration of a transitive model is a transitive filtration.
    So, we need to find a filtration that preserves directedness.

b. Similarly, we need to find a filtration that preserves linearity.

c. By Harrop's theorem, all finitely axiomatizable logics (such as $\mathbf{S4.2}$ and $\mathbf{S4.3}$) with the FMP are decidable.

# Exercise 2

a. We have to check that $A$ obeys all the axioms:

    - Clearly, $J$ is cofinite and $\omega \in J$, and $\varnothing$ is finite and $\omega \notin \varnothing$.
    - For the intersection of two sets $U$, $V$ of $A$:
        - If both are cofinite with $\omega$, their intersection is again cofinite and contains $\omega$.
        - If both are finite without $\omega$, their intersection is again finite and does not contain $\omega$.
        - If one is finite and the other is cofinite, their intersection must be finite (as it is a subset of the finite one, in particular), and cannot contain $\omega$, as the finite set does not.
    - For the complement of $U$:
        - If the set is finite without $\omega$, then its complement contains $\omega$, and by definition of cofiniteness is cofinite.
        - If the set is cofinite with $\omega$, then its complement does not contain $\omega$, and by definition of cofiniteness is finite.
    - For the diamond property of $U$:
        - If the set is finite without $\omega$, we have four possibilities: either $\omega + 1 \in U$ or $\omega + 1 \notin U$, and either $U \cap \mathbb{N} = \varnothing$ or $U \cap \mathbb{N} \neq \varnothing$.
            Whether $\omega + 1$ is in $U$ or not, $\omega + 1$ does not have predecessors, so that does not affect $\Diamond_R U$.
            If $U \cap \mathbb{N} = \varnothing$, then $\Diamond_R U = \varnothing$.
            Otherwise, the predecessors of $U \cap \mathbb{N}$ are $\{ n \in \mathbb{N} | n > \mathrm{min} U \} \cup \{ \omega \}$, which is cofinite and contains $\omega$.
        - If the set is cofinite and contains $\omega$, then it necessarily contains a natural number, thus $\Diamond_R U = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} | n > \mathrm{min} U \} \cup \{ \omega, \omega + 1 \}$, which is cofinite and contains $\omega$.

    b. We want to show that, for every admissible valuation $V$ and every state $x$ in $J$, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), x \Vdash \mathrm{vB}$.
        We consider the following cases:

        - $x \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{ \omega \}$.
            Observe that $x$ has $0$ as a successor, but $0$ has no successors of its own, i.e. $(\mathfrak{J}, V), 0 \not \Vdash \Diamond \top$.
            Hence, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), x \not \Vdash \Box \Diamond \top$.
            As the antecedent is false, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), x \Vdash \mathrm{vB}$ is true.

        - $x = \omega + 1$.
            Its only successor is $\omega$, which does have at least one successor of its own (namely $\omega$ itself); thus, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), x \Vdash \Box \Diamond \top$.
            So, we must prove that $(\mathfrak{J}, V), x \Vdash \Box (\Box (\Box p \rightarrow p) \rightarrow p)$.
            Equivalently, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), \omega \Vdash \Box (\Box p \rightarrow p) \rightarrow p$.
            So, we have to see that, if for every $y$ in $\mathbb{N} \cup \{ \omega \}$, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), y \Vdash \Box p \rightarrow p$, then $\omega \in V(p)$.

            Suppose that for every $y$ in $\mathbb{N} \cup \{ \omega \}$, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), y \Vdash \Box p \rightarrow p$.
            In particular, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), 0 \Vdash \Box p \rightarrow p$, but $0$ has no successors, thus necessarily $0 \in V(p)$.
            Then, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), 1 \Vdash \Box p \rightarrow p$, and so $1 \in V(p)$.
            By induction, then, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), n \Vdash \Box p \rightarrow p$ for all natural $n$.
            Now, observe that $\mathbb{N} \subseteq V(p)$, so $V(p)$ is not finite.
            This means that $V(p)$ has to be cofinite, and contain $\omega$, as we wanted to see.

    c. \-

    d. It is easy to see that, in any admissible valuation $V$, $(\mathfrak{J}, V), \omega + 1 \not \Vdash \Box \Diamond \top \rightarrow \Box \bot$: as discussed in (b), $(\mathfrak{J}, V), \omega + 1 \Vdash \Box \Diamond \top$ is always true, but $(\mathfrak{J}, V), \omega + 1 \Vdash \Box \bot$ (which would mean that $\omega + 1$ has no successors), is false.

    e. Suppose $\mathbf{KvB}$ is sound and complete with respect to Kripke frames $\mathrm{Fr}(\mathbf{KvB})$.
        By completeness, $\vdash_{\mathbf{KvB}} \Box \Diamond \top \rightarrow \Box \bot$.
        As seen in the lecture, all normal modal logics are sound and complete with respect to general frames.
        So, in particular, $\vdash_{\mathbf{KvB}} \Box \Diamond \top \rightarrow \Box \bot \implies \mathrm{GFr}(\mathbf{KvB}) \Vdash \Box \Diamond \top \rightarrow \Box \bot$.
        But, as we have seen, that is not the case.
